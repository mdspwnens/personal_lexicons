DD aka Darth Dawkins is a low-rent presupper who nonetheless gets the upper-hand in 
many of his debates against unseasoned opponents. This is due to many reasons with the 
most obvious being his ability to control conversations and lack of charity. Another 
handle of DD's is EF aka Evolution False which is an older name.

The following tips and resources should help crush his bones.



##                                     -=[ TLDR; ]=-

Darth Dawkins is a dishonest interlocutor. He deserve near zero charitably.  

1. Never let him answer a question with a question

2. Always ask him to DE-fine terms

3. Require DE-finitions to be informative

4. Always ask for the arguments for any claims he makes

5. Ask for him to post sources for empirical claims, and check the sources, because 

they will often contradict his position

6. Don't allow him to interrupt you

##                         -=[ DE-flating DD DE-bate tactics ]=-

Regarding DE-bating specifically, DD uses the following tactics to DE-feat his opponents

1. DD will repeat the same question without charity or consideration of answers offered

-Don't hesitate to ask him to state the question another way if he employs this strategy. 
Often the topics are pretty heavy and DD has a way of awkwardly phrasing common concepts/
topics into questions in his own words, which is the next tactic.

2. DD will present concepts as convoluted, long-winded, jargon-laced questions instead.

The following examples of this tactic are coupled with a more approachable reiteration 
of the concepts DD will use in a DE-bate.

WIP

3. DD only plays offense

DD has a knack for this - he's usually the interrogator and even when asked questions 
he'll respond with "I'll answer your question in a second" or something similar

Many of his questions aim to show the problems with other worldviews. 
Don't be afraid to ask him how such problems aren't solved by his worldview.

WIP



##                                 -=[ Misc tips and advice]=-


1. DD is often wrong but he's not wrong about the problem of induction

The POI is a problem epistemologists are still DE-bating. Many people respond to the 
topic way too dismissively and regularly respond with crappy answers.

2. Don't try to respond to the implicit claims baked into his questions. So many 
people fall for this and it's infuriating how many times he's gotten away with making 
the most dubious assertions.

3. There are ways to shut down the presup script he employs

If you give an argument and he responds by questioning your ability to know anything, 
there are a few ways to counter this move.

3.1 Say "I've given an argument with a justification, just tell me what's wrong with 
my justification."

3.2 Ask him how he would respond to the argument if offered by a person sharing his 
worldview. DD claims his worldview allows for logic and reasoning - ask him how he 
would defeat the argument if it was given by a fellow Christian (as it happens, many 
of the arguments against his worldview come from Christians).



##                                 -=[ Definitions ]=-

Presuppositionalism: is a school of Christian apologetics that believes the Christian 
faith is the only basis for rational thought. It presupposes that the Bible is divine 
revelation and attempts to expose flaws in other worldviews.
Link1:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presuppositional_apologetics
Link2:https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Presuppositionalism

Charity: Principle of charity. In philosophy and rhetoric, the principle of charity requires 
interpreting a speaker's statements to be rational and, in the case of any argument, 
considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.

##                        -=[ How to know if he is getting upset ]=-

1."DON'T OVER TALK ME"

2."DON'T TALK PAST ME"

3."I'LL BAN YOU FROM MY SERVER"

4."I'LL MUTE YOU"

5."I'LL TURN YOU DOWN"

6."I'LL LEAVE A NOTE ABOUT (x)"

7."YOUR JUST A TROLL"

Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
Or a huge waste of time giving this interesting human more energy than he’s worth....
A
"Absolute" = That which is true for all time, in all places, for all people.
"Accounts for all dependency states" = Fancy way of saying existence is dependent on the first cause, otherwise
known to DD as God.
"Actual" (facts) = Derived from God's existence.
"Adult-like behavior" = White knighting Darth Dawkins.
"Atheism" = A worldview centered around a "non-personal absolute".
"Atheist Helpline" = “My only outlet for social interaction.” the safe haven DD returns to when he’s not allowed to
mute people and other cuts huge gaping holes in his thoughts (can’t usually get an actual argument out of him).
"Argumentative" = When you push back, disagree and/or when you behave like DD.
"Agnosticism" = Atheism.
“Autonomous reasoning” = Refers to the rapid growth in scientific knowledge and progress that gave credence to
the idea that human reason was sufficient in itself to pursue and attain truth. Hence, the idea of an “autonomous”
person would refer to someone who's capable of making a rational and informed decisions without being beholden to
an external authority intervening, be it directly or indirectly.Treated as a bad thing by Darth Dawkins, who insists that
a person’s “autonomy” somehow “blinds them” and prevents them from “seeing the truth”, aka, accepting
unsubstantiated assertions on blind faith. In short, when Darth talk about people “giving up” their autonomous
reasoning, it means that they have stopped thinking for themselves and accepts the BIble on faith.
“Ad hominem” (attack/fallacy)” - Latin for "to the person", short for ‘argumentum ad hominem’, typically refers to a
fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the
character, motive, AGE or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the
argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. When called out for using this attack, it’s usually
followed up with, “It’s not an ad hominem… How long have you been studying philosophy? I’ve been studying this
since before your 1st picked your nose; I could be your daddy, so therefore your wrong.”
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
B
"Background information" = Allegedly referring to the correct answers to various philosophical and ontological
questions, but used in a manner implying the pursuit of cherry picked answers conforming to his own preconceived
worldview/arguments, and hence a byproduct of confirmation bias.
“Basement” – a primary dwelling place (unfortunately true for a lot of folks on Discord).
“Bloviate” – To elaborate on the specifics of an argument.
“Borrowing from the Christian worldview” = A cheap cop-out used by Darth to credit all merits those who disagree
with him have to God. While flawed, the logical reasoning appealed to stem from his presumption that God exists,
and as the Creator of the universe, everything that is, is derived from God.
“Bible” = the special revelation of God, but somehow not by special pleading… And in case you’re asked, the 5th
book of the New Testament is Acts, the last book of the Old Testament is Malachi and the last book of the New
Testament is Revelation (not Revelations).
“BTFO” – blown the fuck out. Usually stated by the person and supporters who thought they won the debate,
meanwhile everyone who wasn’t convinced of the argument saw it otherwise, that no, indeed the other guy(s) where
BTFO’ed.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
C
"Causal relations/connections" = the string of events that connect anything you utter, ultimately back to God.
"Childish" = In disagreement with Darth Dawkins.
"Class" = a group, set, or kind sharing common attributes.
“Canard” = Usually referring to an unfounded rumor or story, though Darth uses it to describe an attempt at using an
analogy in order to get points across that are inconvenient to his script. See “evasive”
“Community College Lecture” = see Gobbledygook. Ask Darth what his degree is in or what his educational
credentials may be...
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
D
"Deceptive" = Denoting the act of bringing up a point that is inconvenient to his script or not giving a yes/no response
to a loaded question (in which he will ask, do you know what a loaded question is).
“Dillahunty” = Matt Dillahunty. Outspoken atheist and host of The Atheist Experience who banned Darth Dawkins
from calling in to his show, a decision he made largely because of both his disrespectful attitude towards the hosts of
their sister show Talk Heathen, as well as the fact that he was informed that Darth had encouraged people to prank
call the show. Ever since, Darth Dawkins have insisted Dillahunty is afraid to face him.
“Double talk” = Synonymous with Gobbledygook.
“Discord” = the only platform Darth can interact with humans without being completely ignored.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
E
"Evasive" = Denoting someone who is disallowing the usage of Darth's script on them. Giving a non yes/no answer
or giving context of why you’ve answered in the way that you did (see “bloviate”).
"Evolution" = simply defined universal common ancestry.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
G
"God" = that which is ultimate, eternal, personal, absolute and the origin point of all dependant facts..
"Gobbledygook" = Denoting an argument, opinion or belief that Darth disagree with. Alternatively used as a sort of
dismissal if the topic bores him or if it is one he doesn't have a good counter argument for.
“Gold on Mars” = the one thing you can be agnostic on.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
H
"Hecklers" = Synonymous with his usage of the word "troll".
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
I
"I am not hogging the microphone" (cliche) = Occasionally said by Darth as a way of trying to give the impression
of being more charitable with the time he permits interlocutores to speak compared to himself than is actually the
case, as well as a “polite” excuse of continuing to talk over people without letting them respond.
"Interpreted" (fact) = A quality of being derived from God's existence, without which they're somehow not intelligible.
“Iron-clad” = Said by Darth while assuring an interlocutor that the opinion he either have or are about to express is
infallible.
“It necessarily follows” = Roughly synonymous with “iron-clad”.
“I don’t mean to insult you” (cliche) = stated right before a slew of insults commences.
“I could be your Daddy” (cliche) = used as a creepy tactic to undermine/discount everything the interlocutor has
said because they may be younger than Darth be some arbitrary number of years.
"I don’t know" = the ultimate basis of the atheist.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
J
"Jacobins" = Synonymous with his usage of the word "troll". Anyone who shares a similar (most likely accurate)
criticism about Darth.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
L
"Laws of Logic" = Referring to the three fundamental axiomatic rules upon which rational discourse itself is often
considered to be based. A fierce advocate of the unsubstantiated assertion that these are inherent properties of the
Christian God despite their absence from Biblical scriptures. He is prone to meltdowns if you don’t accept this.
“Like a deer in the headlights” = An idiom that refers to someone caught in a state of paralyzing surprise, fear, or
bewilderment. Likened to the tendency of deer to freeze in place in front of an oncoming vehicle, it can be used to
denote one or more individuals who over the course of a debate or a discussion have had their arguments thoroughly
refuted and suddenly finds themselves at a loss for words because they have no immediate idea of where to go from
there. Only occasionally used accurately by Darth, he will more often than not misappropriate the expression while
referring to someone who has, rather than falling into his trap wherein he tricks someone to accept premises that
would subtly lead them to employ faulty reasoning, and hence deprived him of a “gotcha” argument.
"Loaded Question" = a question asked in such a manner that if you say yes, Darth’s point is somehow validated and
true and if you say no, he’ll go through his whole last 20 min of bloviating. Then rinse/repeat by asking the same
loaded question. If you try to nuance out your answer, full stop on getting any thoughts out. Ask Darth if he’s stopped
beating his wife...
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
M
"Mute" = the process of controlling the interrogation by muting (and sometimes deafening) the interlocutor.
“Mod abuse” = Having to endure mods and admins expecting him to follow the rules of the server outside of his own
personal little sandbox.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
N
"Natural Revelation" = the process of looking at a tree or something else in nature and “deducing” that the Christian
God exists..
"Nine-grade lunch table" (cliche) = Darth's nickname for any voice chat that is not an echo chamber where he exerts
authority.
“Necessary prerequisites for intelligibility and/or casual connections”
● Having made the leap of concluding that the principle of cause and effect is somehow evidence for God, this
string of words are typically brought up as a question by Darth, rhetorical or otherwise, for which the correct
answer is “God” or the creation myth presented in the Bible.
● Having also determined that since humans have brains sufficiently sophisticated to process and interpret
information as a bit of a miracle, (in this, he rejects the fact that our brains have evolved this way, and that
we have sacrificed physical prowess for an intellectual one), and the correct answer for how the human
brain is capable of such complex thought is credited to God.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
O
"Overtalking" = Denoting any individual who wants Darth to talk with them as opposed to be talking at them. Trying
to get a word in edgewise after a ten minute lecture on a topic you probably didn’t even reference.
"Oh, oh, oh, ok" = The preemptive phrase uttered as to say, I wasn’t listening to what you were saying, but instead
now I have a scripted response to a straw man version of what I think you kinda of said.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
P
"Pathological liar" = Synonymous with his usage of the word "deceptive".
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
S
"Special Revelation" = Anything you claim to know by special pleading. Usually in the form of reading a Bible verse
or passage.
"STOP!!!" = Time’s up. You’ve had enough time saying 4 fours in succession.
"Server Mute" = see ‘mute’. Darth’s last resort weapon when the interrogation doesn’t go as planned. This power
(and room) was given to him in order to bring more people to the server and it unfortunately works, like a good train
wreck....
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
T
"T.A.G." = Transcendental Argument for God.
"That which is ultimate, universal and unconditionally non-dependent" = "God" or "First Cause", treated as
synonymous. The way to define God into existence.
“The ultimacy of reality” = Synonymous with the above.
"Troll" = A word used to denote someone who disagree with him.
"Trolling" = The act of disagreeing with him.
“Trolling with your mods” = Denoting a moderator or admin enforcing inconvenient server rules.
“Truth” = The universal, unchanging thought(s) that emanate from the mind of God.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
U
"You’re not understanding” (me) = Often said when you fail to answer a question the way he wants you to, namely
a) in a way that will make you agree with him or b) be so obviously wrong that he can ridicule you for it. Often
followed by a tediously long-winded and repetitive word salad to “explain” what he meant, hoping you will answer
differently afterwards, often because the one debating him did too good a job refuting his point the first time around. It
has also been said when he is so secure in his own judgement that he thinks the view in question infallible.
Illustrated when he once bellowed: “NO, YOU CAN’T DISAGREE, THAT MEANS YOU’RE NOT UNDERSTANDING!”
“Ultimate context” = Natural and/or special revelation.
"Uninterpreted" (fact) = A fact that is not claimed to be derived from God's existence, and hence somehow magically
becomes incoherent.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
V
"Van Til" = Dutch-American Christian philosopher and theologian by the name of Cornelius Van Til, credited as being
the originator of modern presuppositional apologetics and whose conclusions Darth have patterned his
narrow-minded fundementalist Christian theological worldview. Often referred to by him as an appeal to authority,
Darth will occasionally refer to a Van Til’s quote “Christianity is true because of the impossibility of its denial”, which of
course is nothing more than an empty assertion. He often use it to validate or re-emphasize his own argument.
"Violating your own principle" = having a varying (lower) degree of confidence/need for justification as one gets
closer to the bedrock of one’s own epistemology. To the pre-supper, this sounds like you know things, but don’t know
things at the same time and in the same way.
Darth Dawkins; aka Crushin’ Atheism, Evolution False - Glossary
W
"Worldview" (fact) = Christianty. Since it’s the only actual way to view anything, no other worldview actually exists.
“White noise” = Synonymous with Gobbledygook.
"Whistling past the graveyard" (cliche) = Often used to denote people who use humour to deal with frightening or
difficult situations. Used by Darth in a derogatory manner when people disagree with him too much, meaning that he
has just somehow convinced himself you are afraid “to face him in an “honest” discussion.’
"Wasting my time" = Uttered before server muting used as a signal that you are getting under Darth’s skin. Not to
worry, there probably is no use of his time put towards productive conversation and/or actual meaningful activity
outside of whatever hole he sits in, behind the computer
