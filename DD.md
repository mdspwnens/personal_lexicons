DD aka Darth Dawkins is a low-rent presupper who nonetheless gets the upper-hand in 
many of his debates against unseasoned opponents. This is due to many reasons with the 
most obvious being his ability to control conversations and lack of charity. Another 
handle of DD's is EF aka Evolution False which is an older name.

The following tips and resources should help crush his bones.



##                                     -=[ TLDR; ]=-

Darth Dawkins is a dishonest interlocutor. He deserve near zero charitably.  

1. Never let him answer a question with a question

2. Always ask him to DE-fine terms

3. Require DE-finitions to be informative

4. Always ask for the arguments for any claims he makes

5. Ask for him to post sources for empirical claims, and check the sources, because 

they will often contradict his position

6. Don't allow him to interrupt you

##                         -=[ DE-flating DD DE-bate tactics ]=-

Regarding DE-bating specifically, DD uses the following tactics to DE-feat his opponents

1. DD will repeat the same question without charity or consideration of answers offered

-Don't hesitate to ask him to state the question another way if he employs this strategy. 
Often the topics are pretty heavy and DD has a way of awkwardly phrasing common concepts/
topics into questions in his own words, which is the next tactic.

2. DD will present concepts as convoluted, long-winded, jargon-laced questions instead.

The following examples of this tactic are coupled with a more approachable reiteration 
of the concepts DD will use in a DE-bate.

3. DD only plays offense

DD has a knack for this - he's usually the interrogator and even when asked questions 
he'll respond with "I'll answer your question in a second" or something similar

Many of his questions aim to show the problems with other worldviews. 
Don't be afraid to ask him how such problems aren't solved by his worldview.

1. DD is often wrong but he's not wrong about the problem of induction

The POI is a problem epistemologists are still DE-bating. Many people respond to the 
topic way too dismissively and regularly respond with crappy answers.

2. Don't try to respond to the implicit claims baked into his questions. So many 
people fall for this and it's infuriating how many times he's gotten away with making 
the most dubious assertions.

3. There are ways to shut down the presup script he employs

If you give an argument and he responds by questioning your ability to know anything, 
there are a few ways to counter this move.

3.1 Say "I've given an argument with a justification, just tell me what's wrong with 
my justification."

3.2 Ask him how he would respond to the argument if offered by a person sharing his 
worldview. DD claims his worldview allows for logic and reasoning - ask him how he 
would defeat the argument if it was given by a fellow Christian (as it happens, many 
of the arguments against his worldview come from Christians).

Presuppositionalism: is a school of Christian apologetics that believes the Christian 
faith is the only basis for rational thought. It presupposes that the Bible is divine 
revelation and attempts to expose flaws in other worldviews.

Charity: Principle of charity. In philosophy and rhetoric, the principle of charity requires 
interpreting a speaker's statements to be rational and, in the case of any argument, 
considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.
